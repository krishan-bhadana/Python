#you are given l and r. for all integer from l to r, inclusive , we wrote down all of their integer divisor except 1.find the integer that we wrote down the maximum number of t.
l=int(raw_input())
r=int(raw_input())
if a==b:
    print a
else:
    print '2'    #because 2 is a divisor of every second number in any range
